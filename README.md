MergeLists
==========

Merging two sorted linked Lists

This program merges to given linked lists with following assumptions 

Assumptions : 

1. Duplicates are allowed

2. list3(n1+n2) = list1 (0..n1) + list2  (0..n2))
  example:list1 {10,20} and list2 {10,20} then merge list - {10,10,20,20}
  list3(4)= list1(2) + list2(2)

3.Given lists would be ascending order.

4.Sample functional testing are done, based on the requirements,further testing can be done
